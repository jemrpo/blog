## Hello World!
Loads of updates this month thanks to Microsoft Ignite and AWS pre:Invent.
But before going into the updates let me share some interesting news and articles I found interesting.

- Want to learn how Discord reduced websocket traffic by 40%, look [here](https://discord.com/blog/how-discord-reduced-websocket-traffic-by-40-percent).

- If you wonder why and how Wafris migrated from Redis to SQLite from one of their use cases, you need to read [this](https://wafris.org/blog/rearchitecting-for-sqlite).

- Everyone is obsessed with FinOps these days, and Duolingo is no exception. They shared the story about how they [achieved 20% cost savings](https://blog.duolingo.com/reducing-cloud-spending/) without compromising performance.

- Have you ever wondered how a change can lead to a massive cost reduction? Recall.ai shares a story of how they slashed their AWS bill by writing a [Rust interface to transport data over Shared Memory](https://www.recall.ai/post/how-websockets-cost-us-1m-on-our-aws-bill).

- The Gitpod team shares valuable lessons on building a scalable and reliable developer platform. A great resource for anyone in the industry. (We're leaving Kubernetes)[https://www.gitpod.io/blog/we-are-leaving-kubernetes].

And now, let's get to the updates!
