## Hello World!
First, let me share with you some interesting news and articles I found this last month.

- A very useful list of tools that can help you with IAM Roles: [Industrial IAM Service Role Creation](https://ramimac.me/iam-service-roles).

- This post is a good reminder of the importance of continuously monitoring your cloud spending. [Increasing your AWS Expenditure by 200% in a week](https://merlingough.co.uk/bags-of-cash/).

- Curious about how far you can push MySQL limits? [Shard Balancing: Moving Shops Confidently with Zero-Downtime at Terabyte-scale](https://shopify.engineering/mysql-database-shard-balancing-terabyte-scale).

- Looking for ways to improve security of your IAM Roles? [An AWS IAM Security Tooling Reference](https://ramimac.me/aws-iam-tools-2024).

And now, let's get to the updates!
