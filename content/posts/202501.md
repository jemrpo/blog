## Hello World!
Happy new year everyone! Let's start this year with some interesting news and articles I found interesting.

- Want to improve your Git skills? Check out this article [Git - Beyond the Basics](https://4zm.org/2024/12/18/git-beyond-the-basics.html)

- Good article about complex systems migrations [How to Actually Migrate Complex Systems in Infrastructure](https://kyle.cascade.family/posts/how-to-actually-migrate-complex-systems-in-infrastructure/).

- Of course, we need to talk about AI, [AI is Creating a Generation of Illiterate Programmers](https://nmn.gl/blog/ai-illiterate-programmers).

- If you think software is just about shinny new technologies, you might need to read this>: [Software is mostly made of people](https://hatwd.com/p/software-is-mostly-made-of-people).

And now, let's get to the updates!
