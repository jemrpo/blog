## Hello World!
Hello everyone! Let's start this year with some interesting news and articles I found interesting.

- [8 Million Requests Later, We Made The SolarWinds Supply Chain Attack Look Amateur](https://labs.watchtowr.com/8-million-requests-later-we-made-the-solarwinds-supply-chain-attack-look-amateur/).

- We all assume our phones share data with third parties, but here you can how it is done, and which information is shared:
[Everyone knows your location: tracking myself down through in-app ads](https://timsh.org/tracking-myself-down-through-in-app-ads/).

- Have you ever wondered how good Redis is for rate-limiting? This post will give you an idea. [Scaling Our Rate Limits to Prepare for a Billion Active Certificates](https://letsencrypt.org/2025/01/30/scaling-rate-limits/).

- [How ClickHouse Cloud uses AWS Graviton to boost performance and efficiency](https://clickhouse.com/blog/graviton-boosts-clickhouse-cloud-performance).

And now, let's get to the updates!
