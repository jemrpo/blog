## Hello World!
First, let me share with you some interesting news and articles I found this month.

Datadog's "State of Cloud Costs" report is out, and you should [check it out](https://www.datadoghq.com/state-of-cloud-costs/).

Want to learn more about queues and you are a visual learner? [This excellent post](https://encore.dev/blog/queueing) will help you.

This is one of those posts that blows my mind because it is very well written and goes deep into the technical details. [How we migrated from AWS to GCP with minimal downtime](https://postgresml.org/blog/how-we-migrated-from-aws-to-gcp-with-minimal-downtime).

And the last one on my list is [A Short IPv6 Guide for Home IPv4 Admins](https://gist.github.com/timothyham/dd003dbad5614b425a8325ec820fd785) that I'm sure it won't help home admins only.

And now, to the updates.
