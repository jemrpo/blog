## Hello World!
First, let me share with you some interesting articles I red recently:

A very interesting article about the infrastructure decisions that a someone made while working on startup and the ones they regretted. It's a very interesting read even if you are not working at a startup. It's always good to learn from other people's mistakes. [(Almost) Every infrastructure decision I endorse or regret after 4 years running infrastructure at a startup](https://cep.dev/posts/every-infrastructure-decision-i-endorse-or-regret-after-4-years-running-infrastructure-at-a-startup/).

If you ever wondered what is the difference between OpenID and OAuth, this extremely smart and short article is for you. [OpenID versus OAuth from the user's perspective](https://web.archive.org/web/20210804165738/http://cakebaker.42dh.com/2008/04/01/openid-versus-oauth-from-the-users-perspective/).

Now going into the SRE world, this great article will help you understand how SLIs, SLOs, and SLAs should first be business decisions then technical ones. [How much uptime can I afford?](https://world.hey.com/itzy/how-much-uptime-can-i-afford-3130e605)

Now, let's go to the updates!
