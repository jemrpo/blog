Quite an interesting August we've been having, and I'm not talking about the crazy weather. Let's cut to the chase and get to the updates.

## Terraform
### HashiCorp adopts Business Source License
This has caused a lot of buzz on the internet these days and I'm not going to get into the details of the license, but I'll leave you with the links to the official [announcement](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-adopts-business-source-license).
A lot of people got worried about this change (not the Pululmi folks), so we now have the OpenTF [Manifesto](https://opentf.org/).

## AWS
### AWS IPv4 charges
AWS announced that they will start [charging for IPv4 addresses](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-public-ipv4-address-charge-public-ip-insights/) even those not associated with a resource. This change will be effective on February 1, 2024. \
This means you have a few months more to clean up your unused IPv4 addresses, or to finally start the IPv6 migration you have been delaying for the last 10 years.

### Mountpoint for Amazon S3 is now GA
This is a great feature that allows you to mount an S3 bucket as a local file system on a Linux instance. This is for those use cases where you need to access the data stored in S3 as if it was a local file system. [Mountpoint for Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/features/mountpoint/).

### Improvements to multi-account management for GuardDuty
This new capability will help customers to manage GuardDuty across multiple accounts through delegated administrators. More info [here](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/08/amazon-guardduty-multi-account-management/).

## Azure
### Azure AD is becoming Microsoft Entra ID
I guess someone decided it'd be fun to confuse all those familiar with the AD name. Fortunately, only the name is changing (for now) [Azure AD is Becoming Microsoft Entra ID](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/azure-ad-is-becoming-microsoft-entra-id/ba-p/2520436).

### Azure AD signing key got stolen
Microsoft says it still doesn't know how [Chinese hackers stole an inactive Microsoft account (MSA) consumer signing key](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-still-unsure-how-hackers-stole-azure-ad-signing-key/) used to breach the Exchange Online and Azure AD accounts of two dozen organizations, including government agencies.

### Retirement: Azure Container Apps preview API versions 2022-06-01-preview and 2022-11-01-preview
If you're using Azure Resource Manager API version 2022-06-01-preview or 2022-11-01-preview to manage Azure Container Apps, [update your API requests to use version 2023-04-01-preview or later](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/azure-resource-manager-api-spec?tabs=arm-template#api-versions).

### Public Preview: Azure Elastic SAN Updates: Private endpoints & shared volumes
With the addition of private [endpoint support](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/elastic-san/elastic-san-networking-concepts#private-endpoints), you can now access Elastic SAN volumes via either private endpoints or via public endpoints that are restricted to allow network access from specific virtual network subnets only. If you require the additional layer of security that private endpoints add, this is an essential update.

### Durable Functions for Python v2 Programming Model
Support of Durable Functions with the [Azure Functions v2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/quickstart-python-vscode?tabs=macos%2Cazure-cli-set-indexing-flag&pivots=python-mode-decorators) programming model for development in Python is now Generally Available.

### Kubernetes 1.27 support in AKS
AKS support for Kubernetes 1.27 is now generally available. this version has over 50 features and enhancements focused on improving security, scalability, reliability, and performance of cloud native applications.

Check the [Changelog](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.27.md) for more info.

### Azure Key Vault references for secrets in Azure Container Apps
Azure Container Apps support for Azure Key Vault references in application secrets is now [generally available](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/manage-secrets?tabs=azure-portal).

Azure Key Vault references enable you to source a container app’s secrets from secrets stored in Azure Key Vault. Using the container app's managed identity, the platform automatically retrieves the secret values from Azure Key Vault and injects it into your application's secrets.

### Private Link service integration for AKS
AKS now facilitates [Private Link Service (PLS)](https://cloud-provider-azure.sigs.k8s.io/topics/pls-integration/) creation for Kubernetes services through annotations, simplifying PLS setup. You can add the necessary PLS annotation to the service manifest file with an 'azure-load-balancer-internal' annotation and LoadBalancer service type.

This eliminates searching for Azure Load Balancer IP configuration for PLS creation, as AKS will handle PLS provisioning with the Kubernetes service. You can also establish a PLS resource by adding the PLS annotation to the manifest file after service provisioning.

### Azure Container Apps enhancements
- Secrets volume mounts for Azure Container Apps [Manage secrets in Azure Container Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/manage-secrets?tabs=azure-portal).

### Public preview: Azure VNet flow logs
Virtual Network (VNet) flow logs enable you to capture information about IP traffic flowing through your Virtual Networks for usage monitoring & optimization, troubleshooting connectivity, compliance, and security analysis.

Flow data is sent to Azure Storage accounts. From there, you can access the data and export it to any visualization tool, SIEM (security information and event management) solution, or intrusion detection system (IDS) of your choice. You can also enable Traffic Analytics that aggregates and enriches flow data to provide advanced visibility into user and application activity as well as malicious IP communication in your networks. [VNet flow logs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/vnet-flow-logs-overview).
