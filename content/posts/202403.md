## Hello World!
First, let me share with you some interesting articles I read recently:

This article talks about the evolution of SSDs and how this is not being reflected in the Cloud,
[SSDs Have Become Ridiculously Fast, Except in the Cloud](https://databasearchitects.blogspot.com/2024/02/ssds-have-become-ridiculously-fast.html).

This post from the Allegro team talks about how they used eBPF to troubleshoot some performance
issues they were noticing on their Kafka environment, [Unlocking Kafka's Potential: Tackling Tail Latency with eBPF](https://blog.allegro.tech/2024/03/kafka-performance-analysis.html).

First HashiCorp announced they were changing their [licensing model for Terraform](https://thenewstack.io/open-source-in-numbers-the-terraform-license-change-impact-on-contribution/). Now we learn they are 
[looking to be acquired](https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/18/hashicorp_sale_report/). Now, pray to the Cloud Gods Broadcom doesn't buy them. I'd be very careful if I were to use some of HashiCorp's products in my platform.

Redis INC decided to change their licensing for future releases, Once again, the [Open Source Community comes to the rescue](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-launches-open-source-valkey-community).

And last but not least, [Malicious SSH backdoor sneaks into xz, Linux world's data compression library](https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/29/malicious_backdoor_xz/)

And now, to the updates.
