## Hello World!
First, let me share with you some interesting news and articles I found this last month.

If you think reserving compute is the best way to save money in the cloud, you might want to check this: [How we saved $5k a month with a single Grafana Query](https://www.checklyhq.com/blog/300ms-from-every-pod-startup-with-a-single-grafana-query/).

Ever wondered what it feels like to do everything yourself? [The Architecture Behind A One-Person Tech Startup](https://anthonynsimon.com/blog/one-man-saas-architecture/)

[A Note on Essential Complexity](https://olano.dev/blog/a-note-on-essential-complexity/).

Postgres, every day we learn how powerful it is [Postgres is all you need, even for vectors](https://anyblockers.com/posts/postgres-is-all-you-need-even-for-vectors).

And last but not least, a shameless self-plug [Simplifying Event-Driven Architectures: KEDA Scaling with Managed Identity in Azure Container Apps](https://jemrpo.com/posts/keda-mi-aca/).
