## Hello World!
First, let me share with you some interesting news and articles I found this last month.

If you think reserving compute is the best way to save money in the cloud, you might want to check this: [How we saved $5k a month with a single Grafana Query](https://www.checklyhq.com/blog/300ms-from-every-pod-startup-with-a-single-grafana-query/).

Ever wondered what it feels like to do everything yourself? [The Architecture Behind A One-Person Tech Startup](https://anthonynsimon.com/blog/one-man-saas-architecture/)

No intro for this one, just read :) [A Note on Essential Complexity](https://olano.dev/blog/a-note-on-essential-complexity/).

Postgres, every day we learn how powerful it is [Postgres is all you need, even for vectors](https://anyblockers.com/posts/postgres-is-all-you-need-even-for-vectors).

And last but not least, a shameless self-plug [Simplifying Event-Driven Architectures: KEDA Scaling with Managed Identity in Azure Container Apps](https://jemrpo.com/posts/keda-mi-aca/).

More info [here](https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/efa/).

### AWS Lambda introduces new controls to make it easier to search, filter, and aggregate Lambda function logs
You can now capture your Lambda logs in JSON structured format without having to bring your own logging libraries. JSON format allows logs to be structured as a series of key-value pairs, enabling you to quickly search, filter, and analyze your function logs. More info [here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-advanced-logging-controls-for-aws-lambda-functions/).

### Amazon SQS introduces new Amazon CloudWatch metrics for FIFO queues
- NumberOfDeduplicatedSentMessages - The number of messages sent to a queue that were deduplicated.
- ApproximateNumberOfGroupsWithInflightMessages - The approximate number of message groups with inflight messages, where a message is considered to be in flight after it is received from a queue by a consumer, but not yet deleted from the queue.
More info [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-available-cloudwatch-metrics.html).
