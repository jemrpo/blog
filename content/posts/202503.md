## Hello World!
Hello everyone! Let's start this year with some interesting news and articles I found interesting.

- [We are destroying software](https://antirez.com/news/145).

- Something that not only applies to AWS, but pretty much to all cloud providers: [The Missing Tier in AWS Network Controls](https://www.proactiveops.io/archive/the-missing-tier-in-aws-network-controls/).

- Are you also having a bad time with AI Crawlers? This is of your interest [Cloudflare builds an AI to lead AI scraper bots into a horrible maze of junk content](https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/21/cloudflare_ai_labyrinth/?td=rt-3a).

- If you are interested in this year's State for FinOps Report, [here it it](https://data.finops.org/).

- If you saw the headlines about TypeScript being rewritten in Golang but didn't have time to read the article, here's a [great summary](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1j8shzb/comment/mh8khdw/).

And now, let's get to the updates!
