## Hello World!
First, let me share with you some interesting news and articles I found this month.

Cool post about using DuckDB as a `jq` replacement, nice trick to have in your pocket whenever you 
don't feel like using `jq` or `Pandas` for data exploration. [DuckDB as the new jq](https://www.pgrs.net/2024/03/21/duckdb-as-the-new-jq/).

After the controversial remarks that Jensen Huang made about learning to code, here is a good post that brings a different perspective to the table. [The demise of coding is greatly exaggerated](https://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2024/03/the-demise-of-coding-is-greatly.html).

Looking to understand the technologies available for server-to-client communications for web applications? Look no further [WebSockets vs Server-Sent-Events vs Long-Polling vs WebRTC vs WebTransport](https://rxdb.info/articles/websockets-sse-polling-webrtc-webtransport.html).

Essay - [Any Technology Indistinguishable From Magic is Hiding Something](https://www.fromjason.xyz/p/notebook/any-technology-indistinguishable-from-magic-is-hiding-something/).

[HashiCorp has been acquired by IBM](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-joins-ibm), and if I
were you, I'd start looking for alternatives to Terraform and all the other HashiCorp products on your platform.

And now, to the updates.
