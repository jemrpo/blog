# Juan's Tech Stack Updates

## Terraform 
### Checks
Terraform [Terraform Check](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/checks) was introduced in version 1.5.0. It is a command that helps you validate your infrastructure using assertions. \
There is a great blog post on HashiCorp's blog that explains how to use the `check` command in real-life scenarios

## Azure
### Virtual Network Encryption - Preview
With this, users can enable encryption of traffic between Virtual Machines and VMSS within the same virtual network and between regionally and globally peered virtual networks. \ 
Encryption is done at the data-link layer, using the IEEE 802.1AE MAC Security Standards (MACsec). For additional information visit the [Virtual Network Encryption](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-encryption-overview) Azure documentation.

### Microsoft Dev Box is Now GA
This reminds me of AWS's Cloud9 IDE and a podcast I heard recently where they were talking about the need for development environments in the cloud for those use cases that have high-security requirements and other exciting use cases. This finally closes the gap from the Azure side, where many customers were deploying AVD for their developers. [Microsoft Dev Box](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/dev-optimized-cloud-based-workstations-microsoft-dev-box-is-now-generally-available/).

### Private Link support for Application Gateway is now GA
Private Link for Application Gateway allows you to connect workloads over a private connection spanning across VNets and subscriptions. When configured, a private endpoint is placed into a defined virtual network's subnet, providing a private IP address for clients looking to communicate with the gateway. \
Here's the official documentation [Application Gateway Private Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/private-link), and here's the link with the instructions to configure it [Configure Application Gateway Private Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/private-link-configure)

### Azure Front Door Migration Tools now GA
The tools that help you migrate from Azure Front Door Classic to Standard or Premium is now GA. [Azure Front Door Migration Tool General Available](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-networking-blog/azure-front-door-migration-tool-general-available/ba-p/3826836). \
And for those needing to migrate from Azure Front Door Standard to Premium, there is a tool that can help you with this process [Upgrade from Azure Front Door Standard to Premium](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/tier-upgrade)
