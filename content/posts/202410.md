## Hello World!
First, let me share with you some interesting news and articles I found this last month.

- Daily updated [IP address](https://www.ipranges.cloud/) data and stats of all main public cloud providers like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Cloudflare, DigitalOcean, Fastly, Oracle Cloud, and more.

- Hard to believe but [AWS claims customers are packing bags](https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/17/aws_cma_investigation/?) and heading back on-prem.

- Advanced Container Networking Services: [Enhancing security and observability in AKS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/advanced-container-networking-services-enhancing-security-and-observability-in-aks/).

- In case you want to know a bit more how Azure SQL Serverless database works, [here is a post I wrote](https://jemrpo.com/posts/mssql-serverless/) a few days ago.

And now, let's get to the updates!

## AWS
### Amazon S3 adds Service Quotas support for S3 general purpose buckets
You can now manage your Amazon S3 general purpose bucket quotas in Service Quotas. You can view the total number of buckets in an AWS account, compare that number to your bucket quota, and request a service quota increase. More info [here](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/s3/quotas).

### Amazon MSK APIs now supports AWS PrivateLink
This allows you to invoke Amazon MSK APIs from within your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) without traversing the public internet. More info [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/vpc/latest/privatelink/privatelink-access-aws-services.html).

### Amazon Data Firehose delivers data streams into Apache Iceberg format tables in Amazon S3
With this new feature, Firehose integrates with Apache Iceberg, so customers can deliver data streams directly into Apache Iceberg tables in their Amazon S3 data lake. More info [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/apache-iceberg-destination.html).

### Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) now supports BYOIP and BYOASN in all AWS Local Zones
If your applications use trusted IP addresses and Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) that your customers or partners have allowed in their networks, you can run these applications in AWS Local Zones without requiring your partners or customers to change their allow-lists. More info [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-byoip.html).

### Amazon EC2 now supports Optimize CPUs post instance launch
You can now modify the number of vCPUs and/or disable the hyperthreading of a stopped EC2 instance to save on vCPU-based licensing costs. More info [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-optimize-cpu.html).

### Mountpoint for Amazon S3 CSI driver introduces new access controls for individual Kubernetes pods
More info [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/s3-csi.html).

### AWS Lambda now detects and stops recursive loops between Lambda and Amazon S3
This preventative guardrail that automatically detects and stops recursive invocations between Lambda and other supported services, preventing unintended usage and billing from runaway workloads. More info [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-recursion.html).

### Console to Code to generate code is now Generally Available
Console to Code makes it simple, fast, and cost-effective to move from prototyping in the AWS Management Console to building code for production deployments. More info [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/console-to-code.html).

### Cross-zone enabled Network Load Balancer now supports zonal shift and zonal autoshift
Zonal shift allows you to quickly shift traffic away from an impaired Availability Zone (AZ) and recover from events such as bad application deployment and gray failures. More info [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/zonal-shift.html).

### Amazon Redshift now supports refresh interval in a zero-ETL integration
When you specify a non-zero refresh interval to your integration, the ongoing replication process will only start after the specified interval has elapsed. More info [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/zero-etl-using.creating-db.html).

### AWS Network Firewall now supports configurable TCP idle timeout
More info [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/).

### Amazon Virtual Private Cloud launches new security group sharing features
When using shared VPC, you can now also share security groups with participant accounts in that shared VPC using Shared Security Groups. More info [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/security-group-sharing.html).

### Amazon Redshift now supports incremental refresh on Materialized Views (MVs) for data lake tables
This capability helps customers improve query performance for their data lake queries in a cost effective and efficient manner. By enabling incremental refresh for MVs, customers can maintain up-to-date data in a more efficient and affordable way. More info [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/materialized-view-external-table.html).

### AWS announces UDP support for AWS PrivateLink and dual-stack Network Load Balancers
Until now, AWS PrivateLink only supported TCP, while NLB supported UDP only over IPv4. This launch enables customers who use AWS PrivateLink and clients that use IPv6 to access UDP-based applications such as media-streaming, gaming, VoIP and other applications. More info [here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/accelerate-ipv6-application-migration-with-aws-privatelink-and-dual-stack-network-load-balancers-udp-support/).
