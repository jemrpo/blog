## Azure
### Index tuning in Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server
Now you can use index tuning to analyze the most resource intensive set of queries in your workload and produce recommendations of indexes that, once created, improve the performance of those queries.
More info [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/concepts-index-tuning).

### Enhanced AKS logs with Kubernetes metadata and logs
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) logs now include detailed metadata, such as PodLabels, PodAnnotations, PodUid, Image, ImageID, ImageRepo, and ImageTag.
These additions provide richer context and improved visibility into workloads, aiding in troubleshooting and monitoring.
More info [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-logs-schema#kubernetes-metadata-and-logs-filtering).

### Control the default NGINX ingress controller configuration is in preview
When you enable the application routing add-on with NGINX, it creates an ingress controller configured with a public facing Azure Load Balancer. Starting with Kubernetes 1.30, you can control this behavior when enabling the add-on by choosing if it gets a [public or an internal IP](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/app-routing-nginx-configuration?tabs=azurecli#common-configurations).

### Force attach/detach API support in AKS
With the release of Kubernetes v1.30, the Azure Disk CSI driver has adopted the force detach capability. This feature allows the driver to force detach zone-redundant storage (ZRS) data disks from VM nodes in a failed zone and attach them to another VM, reducing the Recovery Time Objective (RTO). More info [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disks-redundancy#zone-redundant-storage-for-managed-disks).

### GPU-enabled Windows Node Pools in AKS
When creating a Windows agent pool with GPU support, you have the option to specify the type of GPU driver using the --driver-type flag. 

The available options are: 
- GRID: For applications requiring virtualization support. 
- CUDA: Optimized for computational tasks in scientific computing and data-intensive applications.

More info [here](https://aka.ms/aks/windowsgpu).

### IMDS restriction support in AKS
Currently, all pods on AKS nodes can access the AKS worker node's Azure Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) endpoint. 
AKS now offers a managed solution that restricts IMDS endpoint access for customer pods.
More info [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/imds-restriction).

### Parallel image pulls by default in AKS
Starting with AKS version 1.31 preview, AKS defaults to parallel image pulls. Generally, serialized image pulls are less performant than parallel pulls, especially when dealing with large or numerous container images.
More info [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/azure-kubernetes/availability-performance/container-image-pull-performance).

### Security Baseline with auto-remediation for Linux hybrid workloads
Key highlights of the Azure security baseline for Linux:
- Provided at no cost, except for the Azure Arc workloads (on-prem / other CSP). 
- Enhanced compliance experience with more accurate state (Public Preview). 
- Detailed information about the state of compliance (Public Preview) 
- Fully open-sourced engine for compliance and remediation (Public Preview). 
- Auto-remediation capabilities against the security baseline (Limited Public Preview).

More info [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/osconfig/quickstart-sec-baseline-mc?tabs=azure-cli).

### Network isolated cluster in AKS is in public preview
Today you can control an AKS cluster's egress traffic using Azure Firewall. While this configuration is intended to isolate the cluster to protect sensitive business or customer data, it adds an additional layer of management complexity and cost.  
AKS now provides the option to use network isolated clusters to simplify the process of restricting network access and reduce the risk of unintentional exposure of the cluster's public endpoints to prevent security breaches.
More info [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-network-isolated).

### TLS changes for Azure Event Grid
Support for TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 will end on March 1, 2025. More info [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2282034).
