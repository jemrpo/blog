### Azure CNI static block allocation for pods subnet
Azure CNI Pod Subnet - Static Block Allocation enables VNET routed IP addresses that can scale to over 1M pods, providing the simplicity and low latency of a flat network. Each node receives pre-allocated CIDR blocks, and all pods on that node obtain IP addresses from these ranges. This approach delivers massive scale, previously only available with overlay networks (up to 1M pods) while maintaining all the benefits of a flat network architecture. It also works seamlessly alongside existing dynamic IP allocation for pod subnet – simply deploy it on new node pools with dedicated subnets.
