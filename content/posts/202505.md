VMware environments have long been foundational to enterprise IT, but rising costs and vendor uncertainty are prompting organizations to rethink their strategies. Despite the urgency, VMware workload migration has historically been slow and error-prone. AWS Transform changes that. With agentic AI, [AWS Transform](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/accelerate-the-modernization-of-mainframe-and-vmware-workloads-with-aws-transform) automates the full modernization lifecycle—from discovery and dependency mapping to network translation and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) optimization

### Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus launches query insights and control capabilities
Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus, a fully managed Prometheus-compatible monitoring service, now provides the capability to [identify expensive PromQL queries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prometheus/latest/userguide/AMP-APIReference-QueryMetrics.html), and limit their execution. This enables customers to monitor and control the types of queries being issued against their Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus workspaces.

### AWS Secrets Manager announces support for cost allocation tags for secrets
AWS Secrets Manager now enables customers to [allocate and track cost for their secret usage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/managing-secrets_tagging.html). Customers can categorize their secret costs by department, team, or application using AWS cost allocation tags. You can leverage this feature by tagging your secrets and enabling them in Cost Allocation Tags.

### Cost Optimization Hub now supports Savings Plans and reservations preferences
[Cost Optimization Hub](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/cost-optimization-hub/), a feature within the Billing and Cost Management Console, now allows you to configure preferred Savings Plans and reservation term and payment options preferences, so you can see your resulting recommendations and savings potential based on your preferred commitments.

### Azure NetApp Files Cross-Zone and Cross-Region Replication Across Subscriptions is now Generally Available
More info [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/whats-new).

### Premium Ingress in Azure Container Apps
By configuring your ingress proxy to run on workload profiles, you can scale out more ingress instances to handle more load. Running the ingress proxy on a workload profile will incur associated costs. More info [here](https://aka.ms/aca/ingress-config).

### Durable Functions v3 in Azure Functions is now Generally Available
Major improvements in this new major version include improved cost efficiency for usage of Azure Storage v2 accounts and an upgrade to the latest Azure Storage SDKs, as well as the .NET Framework used by the extension.

More info [here](https://aka.ms/azmon-prometheus-visualizations).

### Custom Certificate Authority Support in AKS is now Generally Available
More info [here](https://aka.ms/aks/custom-certificate-authority).

### Every AKS Version is Now Long Term Support (LTS) Compatible
AKS will now ensure that every community version released (GA) is compatible with long term support (LTS), starting with version 1.28 LTS from April 2025. Versions 1.27, 1.28, 1.29, and 1.30 are now LTS, with 1.31 and 1.32 expected soon. More info [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/supported-kubernetes-versions?tabs=azure-cli#aks-kubernetes-release-calendar).

### Smart VM defaults in AKS is now Generally Available
Previously, the default AKS VM SKU was typically Standard_DS2_V2, but now you can expect dynamic outcomes in default provisioning based on SKU availability. More info [here](https://aka.ms/smartvmdefaults).

### Azure Traffic Manager SLA Raised to 100%
More info [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-overview) and [here](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/view/Service-Level-Agreements-SLA-for-Online-Services?lang=1).

### Private Subnets are Generally Available
Currently, when virtual machines are created in a virtual network without any explicit outbound connectivity, they are assigned a default outbound public IP address. These implicit IPs are subject to change, not associated with a subscription, difficult to troubleshoot, and do not follow Azure's model of "secure by default" which ensures customers have strong security without additional steps needed.  The private subnet feature prevents this insecure implicit connectivity for any newly created subnets by setting the "default outbound access" parameter to false. You can then pick your preferred method for explicit outbound connectivity, such as a NAT Gateway or Public IP address. More info [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/default-outbound-access).

### Azure Front Door Premium Now Supports Container Apps and Functions as Private Link Enabled Origins
More info [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/how-to-integrate-with-azure-front-door?pivots=azure-portal) and [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/standard-premium/how-to-enable-private-link-web-app).

### Azure Front Door Support For Origin Authentication via Managed Identity is in Public Preview
More info [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/frontdoor/origin-authentication-with-managed-identities).

### Application Awareness in Azure Migrate is in Public Preview

More info [here](https://aka.ms/AzureMigrateBuild2025Blog).

### Server-Sent Events (SSE) with Application Gateway is in Public Preview
Azure Application Gateway supports use of Server-sent events in preview, enabling real-time data streaming from server to client. Server-sent events utilize server push technology on a persistent HTTP connection for seamless updates to the clients. More info [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/use-server-sent-events).

### DNAT on Azure Firewall Private IP Address is now Generally Available
DNAT on Azure Firewall Private IP address helps connect overlapped IP networks, which is a common scenario for enterprises when onboarding new partners to their network or merging with new acquisitions. This capability is also relevant for hybrid scenarios, connecting on-premises datacenters to Azure, where DNAT bridges the gap, enabling communication between private resources over non-routable IP addresses. More info [here](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azurenetworksecurityblog/private-ip-dnat-support-preview-and-scenarios-with-azure-firewall/4230073).
